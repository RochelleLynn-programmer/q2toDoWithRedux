# q2toDoWithRedux
This assessment was completed during the second quarter of the year that I studied at Kenzie Academy

Please clone repo onto your machine, run the command npm i to install dependencies, then npm start to run the program. 

The purpose of this assessment was to practice with redux and passing props around components that are in an organized tree structure. 

(CSS was not written by me)
